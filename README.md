# 🎓 School Database Management System

- This project is a simple Student Management System built using Python (Tkinter GUI) as part of my internship at CADD Centre, Thanjavur.
- It allows users to add, view, and delete student records in a clean graphical interface.

## 🧠 Objective

- The main objective of this project is to manage student information efficiently.
- It provides a basic GUI for adding, viewing, and deleting students without using a database backend — ideal for learning Tkinter and GUI-based programming.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **GUI Library:** Tkinter
- **Widgets Used:** Label, Entry, Button, Treeview, Messagebox
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Add student details (Name, Age, Grade)
- ✅ Display all students in a table format
- ✅ Delete selected student from the list
- ✅ Validation for empty fields
- ✅ Pop-up message boxes for success and error notifications
- ✅ Clean and colorful UI (Purple theme)

## 🧩 Functionalities Explained

### 1️⃣ Add Student
- When all fields (Name, Age, Grade) are filled, the student record is added to the table.
- A success message box appears:

 >**“All the fields are stored!”**
### 2️⃣ Delete Student
- Select a student from the list and click Delete Student.
- If no student is selected, an error message box appears:

### 3️⃣ Input Validation
- If any field is empty when adding a student, an error message box is shown:

>**“All the fields must be filled!”**
